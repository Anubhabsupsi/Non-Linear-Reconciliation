# Non-Linear-Reconciliation

Nonlinear forecast reconciliation becomes necessary when the relationships among time series variables are governed by non-additive constraints â€” for instance, **ratios**, **maxima**, or physical laws  (**power flow equations**) in energy systems. These nonlinear structures frequently arise in energy networks, transport systems, and engineering domains, where ensuring physically consistent forecasts improves operational reliability and supports better planning and control. Current probabilistic reconciliation methods are although extensive - with optimal solutions for Gaussian distributions, various algorithms for discrete and mixed distributions, the literature is limited to linear contraints. 

In this study, we focus on nonlinear reconciliation, in which the time series are linked by a nonlinear function f. We assume f to be known. We propose four probabilistic methods for nonlinear forecast reconciliation, which extend the existing linear reconciliation methods for the nonlinear case.
